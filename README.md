##Demonstration on Authentication Using Firebase with react-native

##This project incorporates the ability to log a user in and out with an account that is connected to a Firebase server I set up. In addition, there is a spinner added for a better UX experience that is rendered while the app loads, or while signing in or out.

##Another key feature is the app registry file for both android and iOS are set up to both render from a single app.js file so that both can be developed simultaneously.

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course'
which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.
