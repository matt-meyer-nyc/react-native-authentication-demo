##Demonstration on Authentication Using Firebase with react-native

##This project incorporates the ability to log a user in and out with an account that is connected to a Firebase server I set up. In addition, there is a spinner added for a better UX experience that is rendered while the app loads, or while signing in or out.

##Another key feature is the app registry file for both android and iOS are set up to both render from a single app.js file so that both can be developed simultaneously.

##*Being a demo, this only features login/logout info for particular users created in Firebase. You can login with username: tim@test.com / password: 654321*

##**To run: clone root directory, run and npm install, and then the command 'react-native run-ios' the app can then be used via the simulator** 

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course'
which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.

*note: demo assumes user has some basic knowledge of react-native's simulator and has also installed this library*
